## 2024-05-22 - Dynamic Volatility Padding

**Hypothesis:** High volatility in source odds indicates uncertainty or rapid repricing. We should widen our margin to avoid buying a "falling knife" or "rising rocket" at a stale price.

**Change:**
Old: `margin = config.marginPercent`
New: `margin = config.marginPercent + (market.volatility || 0)`

**Expected Result:**
- Reduced fill rate on high-volatility markets (which is good).
- Lower risk of adverse selection (getting filled right before price moves against us).
- Better "smart bid" placement in turbulent markets.
